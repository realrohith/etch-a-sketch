# etch-a-sketch

Skills demonstrated:-
* Setting up an N*N grid of square divs using JavaScript.
* Setting up a "hover" effect so that the drig divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would. This was achieved by changing the div’s background color using JavaScript.
* Asking user for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid is removed and a new grid is generated in the same total space as before so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.
